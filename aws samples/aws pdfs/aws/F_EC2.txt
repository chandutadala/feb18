Region & Availability Zones :AWS Resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide,
these locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. 
Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, 
isolated locations known as Availability Zones. 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): 
===================================
1) This Service is related to Server Configuration
like 
 a) " Type of Instance", 
 b) " What type of OS we need to install",
 c) " Where we need to Launch the server"
 d) " Creating new volumes"
 e) " adding/removing volumes from server" 
 f) " Taking back of the server (Snapshot)" 
 g) " Creating Load Balancers"
 h) " Creating Auto Scalling" etc.


2) We can launch EC2 instances any region. 
 
To Launch an Ec2 instance below resources are required:
=======================================================
a) AMI
b) Security Group
c) Keypair
d) Type of Instance

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) : 
============================
a) An AMI is a template that contains a 
software configuration (operating system,application server and applications) that 
can run on Amazon’s Ec2.AMIs can be used to launch an instance.
b) AMI is specific to the region.
c) Each AMI have its own unique ID.
d) We can Create our own AMIs.

Security Group:
==============
a) SG is a virtual firewall. It can be attached to the Ec2 instance.
b) SG configration is having two parts
    i) Inbound rules
    ii)outbound Rules
b) What type of requests server allows, will be configured in Inboud Rules.
c) What type of requests server can send, will be configured in Outbound Rules.
d) In SG we can Configure only allow rules.
e) One security Group can be attached to Multiple Ec2 instances.
f) One Ec2 instance can have upto max of "5" Security Groups.
 
Keypair:
=======
a) To log in to your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the 
key pair when you launch the instance, and provide the private key when you connect 
to the instance. 

b) On a Linux instance, the public key content is placed in an entry within "~/.ssh/authorized_keys". 
This is done at boot time and enables you to securely access your instance using 
the private key instead of a password. 

c) Keypairs are region specific.

Type of Instance :
==================
Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use 
cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, 
and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix 
of resources for your applications.

Ex :
t2.nano,t2.micro,t2.small,t2.medium,t2.large,t2.xlarge,t2.2xlarge

Note : 
a) You can also attach existing SecurutyGrouop to ec2 instance.
b) you can connect to linux ec2 instance by ssh protocal.

    ssh -i "privatekeyname.pem" username@public_ip
	

Userdata (Bootstrap Scripts):
=============================
1) Whatever the command we write in Userdata feild,
these commands get executed at the time server booting.
2) Userdate can be changed on existing servers only it 
is in "Stopped" state.
3) We will this option to start the some services,
to clear the exsting log files.
4) First line of user data must be 
   "Shebang" (#! /bin/bash), After the we can give in
   any valid os commands.
	
Note : You will find "User data" feild ,In instance creation Process, 
"Configure Instance Details" step is having
section called "AdvancedDetailed".


Change/add  userdata commands on existing ec2 instances: Instance need to be Stopped 
==================================================	
before changing userdata on existing ec2 instance.

Elastic IP(EIP):
================
It is a dedicated public IP address which
is reserved for your account, It can be assigned any ec2 instance in you account.
After attaching it to ec2 instance,Even if we stop the ec2 instance this public will
not be released from instance , It remain attached with EC2 instance.

Create EIP (Reserv EIP):

Elastic Block Storge (EBS):
==========================
In AWS there are 3 types of storges
a) EBS Volume (Elastic Block Storge)
b) EFS  (Elastic File System)
c) S3 ( Simple Storge Service)

1) EBS is primary storge unit for EC2 instance, Only in EBS we can install OS and
  softwares.
2) Its block based storge, Other two storges (EFS,S3) are object based storges.
3) One EBS volume we can be attach to one ec2 instance at a time
4) We can attach EBS volume to ec2 instance, only if Instance & volume in same AZ .
5) EBS,S3 service is availble in all regions, EFS is not availble in all regions.
6) EBS Volumes (Disk) performance is measured by using IOPS(Input Output per second).
7) There are Five types of EBS volumes
    a) GP2
	b) IO1
	c) SC1
	d) ST1
	e) Magantic
Note : Above Five EBS volumes supports various rate of IOPS, And high IOPS have,
high pricing.	
8) 	Outof five EBS volume only below types can be root volumes
	 a) GP2
	 b) IO1
	 c) Magantic
9) Root Volume: Root volume means where we install the OS. At the time of ec2 instance
launch this volume is created.

Attaching Additional EBS volume to Ubuntu EC2 Instance.
======================================================
1) To attach EBS volume to EC2 instance ,Instance and 
volume must be in same AZ.

2) Create a volume in same AZ as Ec2 instance

      "lsblk"
5) Create a file system
     mkfs -t "ext4" <volume_name>	
   ex : mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
   Note : Linux uses "ext4" file system.
6) Create mount dir.
     mkdir <dir_name> 
     mkdir test
7) Map mount dir to volume
   mount <volume_name> <mount_dir>
   ex : mount /dev/xvdf test  

Note : we able to know the file system is created or not
      by runing "file -s <volume_name>" cmd.
       ex: file -s /dev/xvdf

Detach EBS Volume from Ubuntu EC2 Instance:
===========================================

============================*********************=====================================
Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) : 
===========================
Elastic Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming application traffic across 
multiple targets, such as  EC2 instances. 
It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single 
Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

There are 3 types ELBs in AWS:
=============================
1) Classic ELB
2) Application ELB
3) Network ELB

ELB Listener:
--------------
Front End Listener:
==================
An ELB Listener, is the process that checks for connection
request Listeners check for traffic from "clients to the ELB" 

Backend Listener: 
=================
Listeners are configured with ports to check for traffic from ELB to EC2

ELB Features:
=============
a) It may take sometime for the registration of ec2 instance under ELB to complete

b) Elb also monitor the health of its registered instances and ensures that it 
routes traffic only to healthy instances
  -> A health instance shows as "In-service " Under ELB

c) When ELB detects instance is unhealty it stop routing traffic to the instance
 
   -> A unhealth instance shows as "outof-service " Under  ELB
   
d) When ELB service detects ec2 instance is back to healthy it resumes traffic routing to
that instance  

e) By default elb uses ping HTTP (port 80) for health checks

f) registered instance must respond within time period, otherwise it will be considers as unhealty

g) ELB Helath Checks to EC2 Instance:
    i) Health check interval : Period of time between health checks
    ii)Unhealty Threshold : No of consecutive faild health checks that should 
	   occur before the instance is declared unhealty.
	iii)healty Threshold : No of consecutive success health checksthat must occur 
	    before the instance is declared healty

Other Imp Parameters of ELB:
===========================
a) Cross-Zone Load Balancing: If this feature is disabled  ELB sends traffic evenly 
between the AZs , without consideration to the number of registered instances 
in each AZ.

b)Sticky Sessions:With the stickiness feature, you can configure the load balancer 
to bind usersessions to specific application instances. All requests coming from the user during 
the session will be sent to the same application instance. 

  ELB supports two Machanisam to provide session stickiness: 

 i) load balancer-generated HTTP cookies: which allow browser-based session lifetimes, 

 ii) application-generated HTTP cookies: which allow application-specific session lifetimes. 
 
c) Connection Draining : Connection Draining allows existing requests to complete before 
the load balancer shifts traffic away from a unhealthy back-end instance.

d) ELB Idle Timeout : it is the number of seconds a connection can be idle before 
the load balancer closes the connection. 


Practice:
========
1) Create two ec2 instances in different AZs ( allow ssh & Http requests in SG )
2) Install Apache2 webserver on above two instances
3) Apache run on port number 80.
4) Successful apache2 installation will open default apache2 webpage
 (copy paste the "public ip " in the browser.)
5) Default apache2 page location 
    /var/www/html/index.html
6) Create a clasic loadbalncer:    
   a) Goto Ec2 Dash Board
   b)on the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.
   c)Choose Create Load Balancer.
   d)Select "Classic Load Balancer", choose Create.
    i)Provide Required details like "Load Balancer name"   
	ii) Click on "Next: Assign Security group"
	iii) Choose "create new security group:
	     and add http port requests
    iv) Click on "Configrue Security Settings"
	v)  Click on "Next : Configrue Health Checks"
	vi) Click on " Nex: Add Ec2 Instances
	v) Select the instances which you want to add.
	vi) click on Next
	vii) click on " Review and create".
   
7) Copy paste the DNS name into browser.   

Clasic ELB Practice Assignments:
=========================
Q1) Create new "clasic" ELB in Sydney Region, Consider below
      a) Allow ELB to serve only "ap-southeast-2a" & "ap-southeast-2b" AZs
	  b) Launch one ec2 instance in each AZ i.e ( "ap-southeast-2a" & "ap-southeast-2b")
	  c) Install tomcat7 in both Ec2 instances
	  d) add "8080" inbound request entry in EC2 instaces SecurityGroup.
	  e) Register both Ec2 instance with ELB with proper configration.
 Note : In this case "ELB" Instance port must be "8080".

Q2) Create An ELB to run on port number 9090

Q3) Remove "ap-southeast-2b" AZ from Q1 ELB

Q4) Create an Clasic ELB and enable "stickiness".
      a) Lanch 2 ec2 instance and install apache2
	  b) Change apache2 default page content in one ec2 instance.
      c) copy paste elb DNS name in browser multiple tab and check the output.	  
    

Application ELB:
================
Based on application context we can distribute the
load between the application related servers

ex : Prepaid request need to be landed on prepaid servers.
     postpaid request need to be landed on postpaid servers

Target Groups: Group the servers based on Application context.This process we call it as a Target 
groups.	 
	 
Steps to Create Application ELB:
================================
1) Launch four ec2 instances, Install apache2
  a) Create Prepaid application in 2 servers
  b) Create postpaid application in other 2 servers
2) Group the servers based on Application context.This process we call it as a Target groups.
3) Create Application ELB
4) Attach Target Groups to Application ELB
5) Define the traffic rules to send the request different target groups.
    	 
AutoScalling: 
=============
1) Allows your AWS ec2 to grow or shrink depending on your workload

2) AS Ensures that you have the right number of AWS ec2 instances

3)Help you to save by cutting down the number of Ec2 
instances when not need and scalling out to add more 
instances only when it required

4) AS always try to even distribution  of the ec2 instances between the AZs

5)AS can span Multiple AZs within the Same region.Hence it can be used to create 
Fault Tolerant design.

6) No additional cost for launching AS group,you pay for what you use of EC2 instances.

7) AS can grow or shrink your EC2 instances base,according to your nedds.
Hence can play an Important role cost management.

8) It will work with AWS ELB, Cloud watch.

9) AS can Not span across multiple Regions

10) You can determine which subnets will AS group use to launch new instances 
 in each AZ.

11) If AS fails to launch instances in an AZ ( For AZ failure or capacity unavailability ..etc)
It will try in the other AZs defined for this AS group until it succeds.


AS Scalling policy Actions:
=========================
a) Scale Out :  is the process of in which more EC2 instances are launched by 
scalling policy
b) scale- In: is the process of in which in which EC2 instances are terminated by 
scaling policy

There are 2 Auto Scalling components:
====================================
1) Launch configration : it is the configration template we need to defines 
parameters like Instance type,AMI,keypair,SG.
 
 Note :Once template is created we cannot Edit it.

2)Auto Scalling Group (ASG): Here we define Scalling activity process related 
  parameters like.
  a) What type of scalling Activity Manual/Event based
  b) Scalling Activity parameters like "max","min","desire"
  c) AutoScalling helth check types
  
  
Note : 
a) ASG manage's ec2 instances based on defined AutoScalling policy parameters.
b) ASG have 3 imp parameters
    i) Min  : The Min size of the ASgroup
	ii) Max : The maximum size of the ASgroup
	iii)Desire:The number of EC2 instances that should be running in the group. 
	This number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and 
	less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not specify a 
	desired capacity, the default is the minimum size of the group


AS Rebalancing:
==================
a) If AS finds the the number EC2 instances are not evenly distrubuted across AZ,
It will initiate  Rebalancing Activity.

b) The target of this activity would be to reach an even distribution of 
instances between AZs.

c) AS does this by launching new Ec2 instances in the AZs that have less 
Ec2 instances first,then terminating EC2 instances from the AZs that
have more number of EC2 instances.

d) In rebalncing activity AS temprarily launch instances more then what you have 
define in ASG "Max" value .

e) The extra number of instances is less then or equal to 10% of max capacity value. 


What can cause an Imbalnce of EC2 instnaces Between AZs.
=======================================================
a) selected AZ is not having enough capcity instance type, famaly instances.
b) adding removing AZs
c) Manuall requesting terminating of EC2 instances from your ASG.
d) An AZ that did not have enough capacity,now has enough capcity and it is one 
of your ASG Azs.

Q) What will happen if the AS group was at or near max capacity when AZ 
rebalncing kincks in?


Type of AutoScalling:
=====================
a) Manual Scaling :
   i) Maintains a current number of instance all the time
   ii) Manually changes ASG's min/desired/max, attch/detach instances
   
b) Scheduled based scalling: Used for Predicatble load change.
   i) you need to configure  scheduled action for scale out at a specified date/time and to required capcity
   ii) You can configure this action to happen once or at a recuurring schedule.
  iii) schedule action must have a unique date/time   
  iv ) you can edit  a schedule action after you create.
  
c) Event based scaling : Scaling in responce to an event

ASG Health Checks:
=================
a) AS clasifies its EC2 instances status as either Healty or Unhealty
b) By default ,AS uses EC2 status Checks only to determinethe health
status os an instance

c) When you have one or more ELBs defined with the AS group,
you can configure AS to use "both" the Health checks and the ELB
Health checks to determine the instances helath status.

Health Check Grace Period:
=========================
a) It is the time AS waits from the time as instance comes into "Inservice"
before checking its health status.

b) A value of "zero" means no grace period and the 
instance health is checked once it is Inservice.

c) Until the Grace Period timer expires, any unhealty reported by EC2 status checkes, 
or ELB attached to ASG,will not be acted upon.

d) After Grace Period expires,AS would consider an Instance unhealthy is any of
the following cases:
  i) EC2 Status check reports to AS an instance status other than running.

  ii)If ELB health check are configured to be used by ASG, If ELB reports the instance
    status "Out-of-service"

  iii) One source reports the instance as unhealty is enough for AS to mark it for
replacement.

ASG - Unhealty Instance Termination:
=====================================
a)Once AS identifies an instance as unhealthy,it gets scheduled for termination.

b) Unlike AZ rebalncig, termination of unhealthy happens first, then
AS attempts to launch new instance to replace the ones terminated

c) Elastic IP and EBS volumes ges detached from the terminated instances,
you need to manually attach them to new instances.

Attachaching  Exsting EC2 instances to ASG
============================================
a) Instance must be in runing state
b) AMI used to Launch the instance still exists
c) Instance is not part of another ASG
d) Instance is in same AZs of the AS group
e) If the exsting EC2 instance under the AS group,plus the one to be added, exceed 
the Max capacity of the ASG,the request will fail, EC2 instance wont be added.

Detaching  Exsting EC2 instances to ASG
========================================
a) You can manually remove EC2 instances from ASG
b) You can than manage the detached instances independently, or attach it to another 
ASG.
c) When you detach the instance,you have the option to decrement the ASG desired 
capacity.if you do not , the ASG will launch another instnace to replace the one 
detached.

ASG -Standby state:
====================
a) You can manually move an instance from ASG and put it in standby state
  i) Instances in Standby are still managed by Auto Scalling
  ii) Instances in Standby state are charged normal, In service instances
  iii) AS does not perform Health Checks on instances in standby state.
  
Why we need to keep instance in Standby State?
=========================================-----
If you want to trobleshoot the instance or make changes in standby mode,
without having the AS consider that as the instance being unhealthy.

Practice:
========
Q10) Attach any existing ec2 instance to ASG.
Q11) Detach any existing ASgroup ec2 instance.
Q12) What happend if detach ec2 instance from ASG without changing "desire" parameter
value.
