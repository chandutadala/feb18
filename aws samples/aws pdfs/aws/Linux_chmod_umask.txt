chmod : To change the permissions of the files/dir
1) There 3 type permissions in Linux
   a) read(r)   --4
   b) write(w)  --2
   c) execute(x)--1
2) There are three types of people
    a) owner (user)
    b) group
    c) others
3) Three way to give permissions using chmod
    a) numbering
    b) Absolute
    c) adding/removing	

4) Numbering: While giving permissions
   we use three digit number ,
   First digit is belongs to user
   second digit is belong to group
   3rd digit is belong to Others.
   
   ex : chmod 777 file1
        chmod 442 file2
		chmod -R 560 d1
Note : In above type we cant give specific permissions
        to specific person like group/user/others
5) To Avoid above problem we use Absolute permissions.

   ex : assign "Read" permissions only to
       group,without change permissions to 
      user and others.
    
	ex :chmod g=r file1	
		     
6) To add/remove specific permissions without changing
   exsiting permissions.
   
      chmod u+rw file1
	  chmod o-x file1
	  chmod u+x,g-w file1
7) chmod -R : Tochange permissions to dir and file
    which are inside the dir.

     chmod -R d1	
			 
umask:
======
This command is used to change/display umask value.
based on umask value default permissions will
be assigned at the of object creation.

   ex: umask
    display existing umask value.

To change umask value:
    umask <value>
   ex:umask 420

For files:   
========= 
i) umask value is subtracted from "666".
ii) we cant assign default execute permissions
   to files.
iii) if result of the umask is having any
    "execute" permissions combination value,
    it will add "+1" to specific position.
	
ex 1:  umask 224
   
     a)  666
        -224
        =======
         442
   Above value is not having any execute permissions
   combination. so umask doesn't add any +1 in 
   any position.
   user & group get default "read"
   others get default "write" permissions.
   b) create any file 
       touch test123
	   ls -l
   
ex2: umask 521
   
    a)  666
       -521
       =====
        145
  In above result user and others are getting
   execute permissions.For user and others 
   system will add +1.
  b)   666
       -521
       =====
        145
       +101
      =======
        246
For Dir: umask value is subtracted from "777"
