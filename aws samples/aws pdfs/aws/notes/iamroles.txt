IAM Roles:
===========
1) By using roles we can give access of one account
resources to other account.
2) Roles can be assigned to EC2 instances,If EC2 instances
   want to access to other aws services ,it requires
   Access Key and Secreate Accesskey details.If we configure
   these details in ec2 instance,we are compramissing our account
   security, To avoid these type of things we will assign
   roles to ec2 instance.
