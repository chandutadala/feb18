IAM :

of aws services to the users.

Policy:
=======
1) By using policy we assign permission to 
  IAM users.
2) There are two types of policies.
    a) User based policies
    b) Resource based policies.	
3) User based policies: Policy which we can assign
    to the IAM users. There are two types of 
	user based policies
	  a) AWS managed policies
	  b) Customer based policies
4) Resource Based Policy : Policy is directly assigned
   to resource it self only
    ex: On S3 bucket.
5) Policy contains below elements
   a) Effect (M)
   b) Action (M)
   c) Resource (M)
   d) Condition (O)
   e) Version (M)
   f) Statement(M)
   f) Prinicipal(O)
6) Policies are written "JSON" Format
7) Effect: Effect is having two possible values
       a) allow
       b) deny
8) Action: Action is based on service and resources.
    ex : StopInstances
         StartInstances
         RunInstances
         CreateVpc
         CreateVolume
         AttachVolume
         DettachVolume
          etc
9) Resource:The things which can create/destory.
    ex : If we launch two ec2 instances,those two are
         resources,
        If we create Elastic IP ,That also a resource.
10) Resource defination, we give it by using "ARN"
    (Amzon Resource Name) Format
    Arnformat:
    arn:aws:<service_name>:<Region_code>:<Account>:
	resource/RegionType
   ex : Lets take one instance launched in
        mumbai region in "521937342151" Account,
		The id of ec2 instance is "i-23456834".
	ARN Format:

     arn:aws:ec2:ap-south-1:521937342151:instance/i-23456834
