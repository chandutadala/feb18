VPC :
1)
a) Create custom VPC ( 10.0.0.0/16)
b) create 3 subnets
    Sn1: (10.2.1.0/24)
    sn2: (10.2.2.0/24)
    sn3: (10.2.3.0/24)
c) Create Internet Gateway and attach it to VPC
d) Create new routable i.e. RT1
e) Edit RT1 (Step3) , add internet gateway details.
d) add RT1 to SN1
e) Check Route table entry for SN2 & SN3 
f) Enable auto assingment of Public ip to SN1
g) Launch an ec2 instance in SN1 & install java (open-jdk)
h) Launch an ec2 instance in SN2 & try to open google.com page
i) Launch an ec2 instance in SN3

f) Enable auto assingment of Public ip to SN1
g) Enable auto assingment of Public ip to SN2
h) Launch an ec2 instance in SN2 and connect to that instnace.


3)Create custom vpc
a) create 2 subnets
b) make one subnets as public and other one has private
c) launch one ec2 instance in private subnet
d) launch one ec2 instance in public subnet
e) block all ssh & http request from private subnet
f) block http requests from step4 instance 
  ( public subnet instance )
=====================================================================
4)
Create custom vpc
a) create 2 subnets
b) make one subnets as public and other one has private
c) launch one ec2 instance in private subnet
d) launch one ec2 instance in public subnet & connet the
   public subnet machine.
e) connect private subnet machine and install
   a java into that machine.
===========================================
5)
Create custom vpc (10.2.0.0/16)
1) create 3 subnets
    Sn1: (10.2.1.0/24)
	sn2: (10.2.2.0/24)
	sn3: (10.2.3.0/24)
2) Allow ssh request to "sn3" only from sn2.
3) for sn3 ,Allow access to webserver(ex :apache2) which is in sn2 .
